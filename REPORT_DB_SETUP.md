Postgres configuration and setup summary

Date: 2025-10-27

What I changed

- Updated `inndoor_be/settings.py` to support a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable. If set, the app will parse the URL and connect to PostgreSQL. If not set, the project falls back to the existing SQLite database (db.sqlite3) for local development.
  - The parser supports standard URLs like: postgres://user:password@host:5432/dbname
  - A `CONN_MAX_AGE` value of 600 seconds was added for connection persistence; tune for your environment.

- Installed `psycopg2-binary` into the project's virtual environment so Django can talk to PostgreSQL.

How to use Postgres locally or in production

1. Provide a DATABASE_URL environment variable. Example (PowerShell):

   $env:DATABASE_URL = "postgres://dbuser:secret@db-host.example.com:5432/inndoor_db"

   Or add it to your `.env` file (if you use python-dotenv and load it in settings):

   DATABASE_URL=postgres://dbuser:secret@db-host.example.com:5432/inndoor_db

2. Ensure the Postgres database and user exist and that the user has privileges on the database.

3. Run migrations against Postgres once the env var is present:

   C:/Users/user/Inndoor-be/.venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py makemigrations
   C:/Users/user/Inndoor-be/.venv/Scripts/python.exe manage.py migrate

Notes about running migrations here

- I installed `psycopg2-binary` for Postgres connectivity. I did not run migrations against a remote Postgres instance because no `DATABASE_URL` was provided in the environment during this session. If you set `DATABASE_URL` and want me to run migrations here, I can run them.

Recommendations (next steps)

- For production, use a managed Postgres (RDS/Cloud SQL/Neon) with SSL enforced.
- Add automated backups (e.g., scheduled `pg_dump` to object storage) and retention policies.
- Consider `pgbouncer` or connection pooling for high concurrency.
- Add monitoring/alerts for DB health (e.g., Datadog, NewRelic, or built-in hosting alerts).
- Add DB indexes for commonly filtered fields (e.g., `Property.city`, `Property.status`) and create migrations for them.

If you'd like, I can:
- Run migrations here against your Postgres if you provide `DATABASE_URL` (or set it in `.env`).
- Add an example `.env.example` with DATABASE_URL and other env vars.
- Add `db_index=True` to selected model fields and create migrations.
- Create a brief bi-weekly report template for DB changes you can reuse.
